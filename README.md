# Mobile Signcryption

## Project Overview

This project is part of Network Security (CSS454) and Cloud Computing (CSS451), focusing on enhancing the efficiency and security of mobile signcryption. This project explores the implementation of signcryption on mobile devices while offloading high-computation tasks, such as cryptographic operations, to an edge computing environment known as a Cloudlet.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop and optimize a lightweight, secure, and efficient signcryption mechanism for mobile devices. By leveraging Cloudlet-based computation offloading, this approach aims to:

- Reduce the computational burden on resource-constrained mobile devices.

- Improve cryptographic processing speed.

- Enhance data security and transmission efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Signcryption Mechanism**: Combines encryption and digital signature in a single process to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

- **Cloudlet Offloading**: Shifts high-cost computations (e.g., hashing, encryption, and decryption) from mobile devices to a nearby cloudlet.

- **Parallel Signcryption**: Implements batch processing to handle multiple signcryption tasks concurrently.

- **Secure Transmission**: Ensures secure communication between mobile devices and cloudlets with our new purposed protocal with header.

- **Header & Mapping Algorithm**: Manages the data transmission and computation mapping between mobile devices and cloudlets.

## Technologies Used

- **Cryptographic Algorithms**: OTP (One-time padding), RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and Hashing functions.

- **Edge Computing (Cloudlet)**: Implements computation offloading techniques to improve performance.

- **Mobile Application**: Developed to integrate signcryption with cloudlet support.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with blockchain for improved transparency and security.

- Optimization of network latency during cloudlet communication.

- enhance the speed of signcryption with appropriate algorithm

- Enhancement of fault tolerance and reliability in the offloading mechanism.
